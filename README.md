# Pitaya-Link

> An Open-Source CMSIS-DAP Debug Probe based on DAPLink

## Description

[**Pitaya-Link**](https://store.makerdiary.com/products/pitaya-link) is a low-cost debug probe based on the CMSIS-DAP (also known as [DAPLink](https://github.com/ARMmbed/DAPLink)) protocol standard. It can be used to program and debug the application software running on Arm Cortex Microcontrollers.

The design enables developers with Drag-And-Drop programming, Virtual COM Port, CMSIS-DAP compliant debug channel, and access to Arm Cortex Microcontrollers in the browser using [WebUSB](https://wicg.github.io/webusb/).

The probe comes with indicator LEDs, a button to reset the target or trigger the firmware update, reversible USB-C connector and easy-to-use 7-pin 2.54mm Header.
